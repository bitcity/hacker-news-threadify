# Hacker News Threadify

Hacker News Threadify (HNT) is a little piece of JavaScript that once executed on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) it allows you to collapse and expand comments in a thread.

You can use HNT by creating a bookmark including the [bookmarklet code](hacker-news-threadify/hacker-news-threadify.bookmarklet.js) or by installing the [GreaseMonkey script](hacker-news-threadify/hacker-news-threadify.user.js).
